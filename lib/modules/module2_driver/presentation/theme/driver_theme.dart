/// The driver module was rebranded "Captain" when the operator app was merged
/// into it (one phone per vehicle, held by the driver). Existing screens keep
/// importing `DriverTheme`; every token below resolves to the Captain palette
/// so the whole module re-skins in one place — and, since Captain gained a
/// light/dark toggle, these are getters that resolve against the live mode.
/// They can no longer be captured inside `const` constructors. New code
/// should import [CaptainTheme] directly.
